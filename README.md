# Weather-tracker

-I wanted to have a website that showed the weather of multiple locations.

-I built this website because I want to have this available on my PC. 

-It solves the problem of having to take out your phone to check the weather. 

-I learned how to create websites using API's.

How to Use:

-Type the city you would like to view

-Click search

-You may chose multiple cities
